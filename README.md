# Automation_CAPL
Here are the projects that are made automated using CAPL Scripting in CANoe.

## LED Indicator
- Automation of LED Project is using CAPL by inserting the Test CAPL module in CANoe.
- LED blinks whenever signal gets 1 on to CAN without switching it manually.

## Init Value DBC
- Creating DBC and attaching it to the CANoe configuration.
- So we do not need to write CAPL script and flow the messages by giving them in the DBC file
- Whichever the init value is given in DBC that will flow onto the CAN without using CAPL.
- Then create a Test CAPL and automate it.
